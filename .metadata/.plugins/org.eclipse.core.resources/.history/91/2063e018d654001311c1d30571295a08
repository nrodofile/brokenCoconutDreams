		&#8216;Small business&#8217; is defined differently by regulators in Australia depending on the laws they administer.
		For example, ASIC regulates many businesses that are 'small proprietary companies', which means a company with two out of these three characteristics:</font><br>		
			<ul type="disc">
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">an annual revenue of less than $25 million </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">fewer than 50 employees at the end of the financial year, and </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">consolidated gross assets of less than $12.5 million at the end of the financial year. </font></ul>
			The Australian Taxation Office defines a small business as one that has annual revenue turnover (excluding GST) of less than $2 million.
			Fair Work Australia defines a small business as one that has less than 15 employees.</font><br>
		Despite these differences, many regulators have informally adopted the definition of &#8216;small business&#8217; 
		used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which is a business that employs fewer than 20 people.</font><br>
