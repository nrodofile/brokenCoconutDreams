        &#8216;Small business&#8217; is defined differently by regulators in Australia depending on the laws they administer.
		For example, ASIC regulates many businesses that are &#8216;small proprietary companies&#8216;, which means a company with two out of these three characteristics:	
			&#8226; an annual revenue of less than $25 million
		    &#8226; fewer than 50 employees at the end of the financial year, and
		    &#8226; consolidated gross assets of less than $12.5 million at the end of the financial year.
		    			
		    The Australian Taxation Office defines a small business as one that has annual revenue turnover (excluding GST) of less than $2 million.
			Fair Work Australia defines a small business as one that has less than 15 employees.<br/>		
			Despite these differences, many regulators have informally adopted the definition of &#8216;small business&#8217; 
		used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which is a business that employs fewer than 20 people.</string>
